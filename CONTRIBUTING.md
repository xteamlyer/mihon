# Forks

Forks are allowed so long as they abide by [the project's LICENSE](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon/blob/main/LICENSE).

When creating a fork, remember to:

- To avoid confusion with the main app:
    - Change the app name
    - Change the app icon
    - Change or disable the [app update checker](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon/blob/main/app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/data/updater/AppUpdateChecker.kt)
- To avoid installation conflicts:
    - Change the `applicationId` in [`build.gradle.kts`](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon/blob/main/app/build.gradle.kts)
- To avoid having your data polluting the main app's analytics and crash report services:
    - If you want to use Firebase analytics, replace [`google-services.json`](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon/blob/main/app/src/standard/google-services.json) with your own
